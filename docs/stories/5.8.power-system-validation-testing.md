# Story 5.8: Power System Integration Testing & Validation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** quality assurance tester,
**I want** complete power system validated with load testing and fail-safe verification,
**so that** Epic 5 power infrastructure is safe and reliable for full robot operation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Test Setup:**
   - All hardware from Epic 5 assembled
   - All hardware from Epic 3 connected
   - Test equipment ready

2. **Voltage Regulation Testing:**
   - 5V rail stable under all load conditions
   - 12V rail ready for Epic 6
   - Battery voltage ranges verified

3. **Thermal Testing (60-Minute Continuous Operation):**
   - All components remain within safe temperature limits
   - No thermal shutdowns or failures

4. **Safety System Testing:**
   - Fuse protection verified
   - Emergency cutoff functional
   - Battery discharge/charge cycles safe

5. **ROS2 Power Monitoring Validation:**
   - Battery voltage monitoring accurate
   - Warning thresholds trigger correctly

6. **Pass/Fail Criteria:**
   - All systems remain stable for 60 minutes
   - No component overheating
   - Safety systems functional
   - Battery monitoring accurate

7. **Documentation:**
   - Test results documented
   - Thermal profiles recorded
   - Battery discharge curve measured

## Dependencies
- All Epic 5 stories (5.1-5.7)
- Epic 3 complete

## Estimated Effort
3-4 hours test execution + 2-3 hours documentation + 4-8 hours debugging if issues found
