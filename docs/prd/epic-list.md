# Epic List

Based on the requirements, technical architecture, and V1 scope from the brief, here's the proposed epic breakdown for Olaf V1:

## Epic Structure Overview

**Epic 1: Foundation, Infrastructure & Minimal Personality**
**Goal:** Establish project infrastructure, power system, ROS2 communication, and deliver a minimal working personality expression (single eye blink + beep) proving the three-layer architecture works end-to-end.

**Epic 2: 3D Design & Physical Structure**
**Goal:** Design all mechanical components in OnShape (head housing, ear mounts, neck gimbal, body chassis, base platform), produce printable STL files, print and assemble physical structure, validate mechanical ranges and fitment.

**Epic 3: Complete Personality Expression System**
**Goal:** Expand minimal personality to full two-dimensional emotion system (7 types Ã— 5 intensities) with coordinated expression across eyes, ears, neck, and beeps.

**Epic 4: AI Agent Framework**
**Goal:** Enable AI agents to control Olaf through tool use and function calling, with hybrid local + cloud AI (Hailo-accelerated Whisper STT + cloud agent reasoning), multi-step planning, and embodied intelligence.

**Epic 5: Autonomous Navigation & Mobility**
**Goal:** Implement SLAM-based navigation using OAK-D Pro depth sensing and ODrive motor control for autonomous apartment movement with obstacle avoidance.

**Epic 6: Information Display & Projection**
**Goal:** Integrate DLP floor projection system for displaying AI-generated content with coordinated physical gestures.

**Epic 7: System Integration, Polish & Cross-Cutting Features**
**Goal:** Complete end-to-end integration, implement Quiet Mode, mmWave presence detection, Power Saving Mode, finalize build documentation, conduct user testing, and prepare for community release.
