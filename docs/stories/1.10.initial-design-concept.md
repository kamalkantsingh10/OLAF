# Story 1.10: Initial Design Concept & Community Feedback

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** maker and open-source contributor,
**I want** to create an initial visual concept in OnShape and gather Reddit community feedback,
**so that** I can validate the aesthetic direction and incorporate community suggestions before committing to the full Epic 2 design work.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **OnShape Concept Sketch:**
   - Free OnShape account created (if not already from Epic 2 prep)
   - Simple sketch or concept model created showing Olaf's overall form:
     - Head shape (rounded, friendly aesthetic per branding guide)
     - Body proportions (target 50-60cm height, 35-40cm width)
     - Basic ear placement (Chappie-inspired triangular/curved fins)
     - Overall stance on hoverboard base
   - Design captures retro-futurism styling (rounded edges, no sharp corners, white/light gray color scheme)
   - OnShape link made public for community viewing

2. **Visual Presentation:**
   - Screenshots or rendered views from OnShape (minimum 3 angles: front, side, 3/4 view)
   - Optional: Simple annotation overlays showing key features (eyes, ears, projector, heart display)
   - Images exported at high resolution (1920x1080 minimum for clarity)

3. **Reddit Post Creation:**
   - Post drafted for relevant subreddit(s):
     - Primary: r/robotics or r/DIY
     - Secondary consideration: r/3Dprinting, r/raspberry_pi
   - Post title: Engaging, specific (e.g., "Designing Olaf - Open-Source AI Companion Robot with Personality - Feedback Welcome!")
   - Post content includes:
     - Project overview (self-balancing AI companion, emotion-driven personality)
     - Design goals (friendly aesthetic, retro-futurism, Chappie-inspired)
     - OnShape public link
     - Specific questions for feedback:
       - "What do you think of the proportions?"
       - "Does the aesthetic feel friendly/approachable?"
       - "Any suggestions for the ear design?"
       - "Concerns about balance/stability with this form factor?"
   - Images embedded in post (Reddit supports multiple images)

4. **Feedback Integration:**
   - Feedback from Reddit informs Epic 2 design decisions (captured in notes for Story 2.2-2.6)
   - OnShape concept serves as starting point for Story 2.1 (OnShape setup) and Story 2.2 (head housing CAD)
   - Community engagement builds early follower base for build-in-public strategy

5. **Quality Requirements:**
   - OnShape model is view-only public (no edit access needed)
   - Reddit post follows subreddit rules (checked before posting: self-promotion policies, image requirements)
   - Responses to community feedback are professional and appreciative (acknowledge suggestions, explain design rationale when needed)
   - Feedback summary documented in `docs/community-feedback/reddit-initial-design-feedback.md`

## Dev Notes

### Design Goals
[Source: docs/prd/user-interface-design-goals.md (inferred)]

**Aesthetic Direction:**
- **Friendly & Approachable:** Rounded shapes, no sharp edges
- **Retro-Futurism:** Inspired by classic sci-fi (Chappie, WALL-E aesthetic)
- **Color Scheme:** White/light gray with accent colors
- **Proportions:** Human-like but clearly robotic (50-60cm height, balanced on hoverboard base)

**Key Features to Communicate:**
- Round TFT eyes (expressive, emotion-driven)
- Triangular/curved ears (Chappie-inspired, articulated)
- Heart display on body (visible, emotion-driven)
- Hoverboard base (self-balancing, recognizable)
- Overall friendly presence

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**3D Modeling:** OnShape (cloud CAD, free for public projects)

### Build-in-Public Strategy
[Source: Epic 1 Story 1.11 (inferred from brief)]

This story extends the build-in-public strategy by incorporating community input early in the design process. Goals:
- Validate aesthetic direction before heavy CAD investment
- Build early follower base
- Gather diverse perspectives on form factor and stability
- Create engagement content for Epic 2 launch

### Reddit Engagement Best Practices

**Subreddit Selection:**
- **r/robotics:** Technical audience, good for stability/functionality feedback
- **r/DIY:** Maker community, good for build feedback
- **r/3Dprinting:** 3D printing community, good for printability feedback
- **r/raspberry_pi:** Raspberry Pi users, familiar with embedded projects

**Post Timing:** Mid-week, mid-morning (Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-12pm EST) for best visibility

**Engagement Tips:**
- Be humble and open to critique
- Acknowledge all feedback, even if not implementing
- Explain technical constraints when declining suggestions
- Thank contributors
- Set boundaries: "This is early concept validation, not all suggestions will be implemented"

### Feedback Summary Template

```markdown
# Reddit Initial Design Concept Feedback Summary

**Post Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Subreddit:** r/robotics
**Post URL:** https://reddit.com/r/robotics/...
**Upvotes:** XXX
**Comments:** XX

## Common Themes

1. **Proportions:** (e.g., "5 users mentioned head appears large relative to base")
2. **Stability Concerns:** (e.g., "3 users questioned center of gravity")
3. **Aesthetic Feedback:** (e.g., "Positive response to rounded design, 'friendly' feel")

## Actionable Suggestions

1. **Wider base:** Consider increasing base width for stability (from user X, Y, Z)
2. **Ear angle:** Adjust ear angle by 15-20° for better aesthetic (from user A)
3. **Color accents:** Add color accents to eyes/ears for visual interest (from user B)

## Design Decisions

1. **Keeping current head proportions:** Head size necessary for GC9A01 displays and camera housing
2. **Adjusting ear angle:** Will incorporate 15° adjustment in Epic 2 CAD based on feedback
3. **Base width:** Monitoring feedback, will test stability in Epic 4 (balancing)

## Key Insights for Epic 2

- Prioritize stability validation in CAD (center of gravity calculations)
- Add visual weight to base (thicker base plate, visible support structure)
- Consider color accent options in OnShape (but print in white/gray initially)
```

### Time Budget

**OnShape Concept:** 2-3 hours (keep simple, this is validation not final design)
**Reddit Post Creation:** 1-2 hours (draft, images, posting)
**Community Engagement:** 1-2 hours over 3-7 days (responses, monitoring)

**Total:** 4-6 hours

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Negative or no response from community
**Mitigation:** Frame as "early concept, iterative process." Remember: feedback is valuable input, not mandatory directive. Use judgment to filter signal from noise.

**Risk:** Over-promising features
**Mitigation:** Be clear in post: "This is early-stage concept. Feedback will be considered but not all suggestions implemented."

**Risk:** Time sink (too much Reddit engagement)
**Mitigation:** Set boundary: Respond to top 10-15 comments, summarize rest. Don't let Reddit consume more than 6 hours total.
