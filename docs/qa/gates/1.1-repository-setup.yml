  - 'Security best practices with proper secrets management'
  - 'Proactive architectural thinking (firmware/ subdirectories not explicitly required)'

  - 'Clean foundation with zero technical debt'

review_notes: |
  This story represents foundational infrastructure work executed at an exceptional level.

  Key highlights:
  - The shared/i2c_registers.h goes beyond minimal requirements with usage examples for both
    Python (orchestrator) and C++ (ESP32 firmware), demonstrating deep understanding of the
    distributed architecture.
  - Security practices are exemplary: .env properly excluded, template includes clear
    instructions, no secrets in version control.
  - README.md correctly updated to reflect sharded documentation structure (prd/index.md,
    architecture/index.md) showing attention to detail.
  - Directory structure not only meets requirements but anticipates future needs with
    firmware/ subdirectories.

  No refactoring required. No issues found. Ready for Done immediately.

  This sets an excellent standard for future stories.
